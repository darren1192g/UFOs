# UFO Are They Out There?

## Provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

### To do this by building a web page interface to handle all request.

- We can start with date 1/13/2010 and we get back 3 results. From this point we can say we know the one we are looking for is in Gulf Breeze FL so we can add that to the filter to find just that one.

- Now we have all the info on this one sighting but say we would like to know what other sightings are in FL we can clear out the date and the city and pull up that information.

- you can change around all the filters to find all the UFO information that is provided in this data base as you please.

## Summary

	The one drawback is we are only filtering one database that we have on hand.  If we could link up more databases, we could have a better output with 20 to 100 hits per filter selection. This would allow for a better understanding of sightings in the area too. 
	We could have more fun with this data and really start to understand it more if we could develop a mapping system to show where all the sightings have been. You could add flitters to change the mapping layout. Now you can see on a map if one area gets more or even see if there is a date that tends to have more sightings than others.The other change to make is to add drop down boxes in the filters and to have saved searches options.
